excerpt: 'At the core of the success of semiconducting spin qubits is the ability to manipulate them electrically, enabled by the spin-orbit interactions. However, most implementations require external magnetic fields to define the spin qubit, which in turn activate various charge-noise mechanisms. Here we study spin qubits confined in quantum dots at zero magnetic fields that are driven periodically by electrical fields and are coupled to a microwave resonator. Using Floquet theory, we identify a well-defined Floquet spin-qubit originating from the lowest degenerate spin states in the absence of driving. We find both transverse and longitudinal couplings between the Floquet spin qubit and the resonator, which can be selectively activated by modifying the driving frequency. We show how these couplings can facilitate fast qubit readout and the implementation of a two-qubit CPHASE gate. Finally, we use adiabatic perturbation theory to demonstrate that the spin-photon couplings originate from the non-Abelian geometry of states endowed by the spin-orbit interactions, rendering these findings general and applicable to a wide range of solid-state spin qubits.'
